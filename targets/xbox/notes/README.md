# Xbox target

This folder mirrors the built web app output into `app/`.

In many real Xbox app scenarios, you'll run this web experience inside a native shell (WebView).
Use this target as:
- a place to keep shell notes, constraints, and any integration contracts
- a place to keep test harnesses / compatibility notes
